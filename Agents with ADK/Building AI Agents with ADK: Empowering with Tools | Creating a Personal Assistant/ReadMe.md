# 🚀 Building AI Agents with ADK: Empowering with Tools  
> _Hands-On Codelab – Google Codelabs_  
> Based on: **[Building AI Agents with ADK: Empowering with Tools](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/devsite/codelabs/build-agents-with-adk-empowering-with-tools#0)**

## 📘 Overview  
This repository mirrors the tutorial from the above Codelab, where you’ll learn how to take a base agent built with the Agent Development Kit (ADK) and **empower it with multiple tools** — from custom Python functions to built-in search, to third-party integrations like LangChain.  

### What you’ll build  
- A base ADK agent with basic prompt logic  
- A **custom FunctionTool** (e.g., real-time currency conversion)  
- Integration of the built-in Google Search tool for live data  
- Integration of a third-party tool (LangChain’s Wikipedia tool)  
- A multi-tool workflow / orchestration of tools by the agent  
- Clean-up instructions to safely remove GCP resources when done
