## 📘 Overview  
In this project you’ll build an intelligent travel-agent application that:  
- Provisions a Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL database containing hotel data. 
- Sets up the MCP Toolbox server to expose database-query tools to agents. 
- Uses ADK to build an agent that uses those tools to answer user queries like “find hotels in city X” or “search hotel by name”. 
- Runs the agent locally and optionally deploys it on Google Cloud.
