## ðŸ“˜ Overview  
This repository consolidates three official **Google Codelabs** for the **Agent Development Kit (ADK)** â€” from the very first prototype agent to a production-ready, tool-empowered travel assistant.  
Youâ€™ll progressively build and extend:  
1. **A basic agent prototype** that can generate structured documents.  
2. **A tool-empowered assistant** with integrated function, search, and third-party tools.  
3. **A database-aware travel agent** that connects to live data via MCP Toolbox for Databases.
